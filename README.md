# Python-OTP-Verification-System
Developing an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system. The system should generate a 6-digit OTP and send it to the user's email address for verification. Upon receiving the OTP, the user should enter it into the system for validation. If the entered OTP matches the generated OTP, access should be granted; otherwise, access should be denied.
